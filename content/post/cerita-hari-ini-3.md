##### Today's Story!

<br>
Hello!üñê

Today i was continuing to make my portfolio for my applicant as a Front-End Developer in Kampus Merdeka. I've been fixing bugs in every project i've made. this one is one of the bug i tried to fix. it's quite confusing before, because it's a different kind of website i've ever made. this website is using Netlify CMS as a Content Manager. It's quite interesting as well because it's written in a markdown language, which is a new thing to me.

It was my teacher who gave me this assignment. It's pretty hard at first, but now i'm enjoying this. If i have a free time, i would like to explore more about it.

See yaa!^^
